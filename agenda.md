- review and check in on last week's work
  - heroku
  - databases and migrations
- software testing
  - Why care?
    - It allows you to refactor your code (what's refactoring)
    - Allows you to Test Drive (TDD) your code
      - upfront thinking on design/API
      - documentation for others (and yourself in the future) about what the code does
      - one concern at a time while developing: 
        - write a failing test (red)
        - do whatever it takes to get it to pass (green)
        - make it simpler, easier to read, modular, and DRY (refactor)
    - Half of your time as a professional developer will likely be spent testing
    - Confidence in your app devolopment = the ability to move fast
- exercise with RubyMonk restaurant
- code styling for readability (maintainability)
- debugging process
